# Trello Data Export

## Description
This script can be used to convert JSON data exported from a Trello Board to a word file. The word file contains only the current state of the board, including cards from all lists with descriptiosn and images. You can read more about alternative ways to export Trello data and about using this script on my [Medium Blog Post](https://shreyasnisal.medium.com/exporting-trello-boards-b412ff32bc2f).

## Usage
To use this script, follow the below steps:
- Download the script
- Export data (as JSON) from all Trello Boards that you want to convert to word files
- Place the script and the JSON files in the same directory (folder)
- Change the access to all boards that you are using to public
- Run the python script and wait for all boards to be converted to individual word files
